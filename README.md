  config.language = :en                                       # optional, default is :en
  config.topic_types = 'ec'                                   # optional, default is 'ec'
  config.api_base = 'https://api.meaningcloud.com/topics-2.0' # optional, default is 'https://api.meaningcloud.com/topics-2.0'
